            <p class="card-text">
              In general, use the Network panel when you need to make sure that
              resources are being downloaded or uploaded as expected. The most
              common use cases for the Network panel are: Making sure that
              resources are actually being uploaded or downloaded at all.
              Inspecting the properties of an individual resource, such as its
              HTTP headers, content, size, and so on.

            If you're looking for ways to improve page load performance, don't
            start with the Network panel. There are many types of load
            performance issues that aren't related to network activity. Start
            with the Audits panel because it gives you targeted suggestions on
            how to improve your page. See Optimize Website Speed.
