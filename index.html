    <h1>Introducing The Network Tab</h1>
    <h2>When to use the Network panel</h2>
    <p>
      In general, use the Network panel when you need to make sure that
      resources are being downloaded or uploaded as expected. The most common
      use cases for the Network panel are: Making sure that resources are
      actually being uploaded or downloaded at all. Inspecting the properties of
      an individual resource, such as its HTTP headers, content, size, and so
      on. If you're looking for ways to improve page load performance, don't
      start with the Network panel. There are many types of load performance
      issues that aren't related to network activity. Start with the Audits
      panel because it gives you targeted suggestions on how to improve your
      page. See Optimize Website Speed.
